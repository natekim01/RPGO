# RPGO
Personal Project using Swift. 
Originally was made during a class on iOS programming. I used this project to learn the ins and outs of the Swift programming language and experiment with using different APIs such as Apple HealthKit and Maps. 

RPGo is based of the wildly popular Pokemon Go game. Where through tracking the the amount of steps a person takes players can level up their characters and gain points to battle their friends. I also used the Apple MapKit and CoreLocation API to generate an item map, where in different places around the user's location, I would place items that would increase the stats on the characters. 
For future plans for this project, I plan on implementing a more robust battling system and leaderboard that players can track their progress against their friends and their communities.
